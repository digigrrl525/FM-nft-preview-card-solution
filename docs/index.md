## My process

I started with the html and css. Then I started in on the hover states which meant I had to re-work a lot of what I had written because I didn't have the correct html flow. 
Of course, then I had to change a lot of my css to get the overlay to stay on the product image when responding to responsive changes.

This project took longer than I expected because I had to research how to create the hover overlay, but I learned a lot and I am proud of the result.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned how to create an overlay to show on top of an image on hover. In the past, I have created hover states that replace elements not overlay them.


### Continued development

I want to learn more about CSS animations.
